This is the popular game TicTacToe written in rust.
On execution it enters an alternate where the game is played. This way you wont lose the history of your terminal.
Also it is colorcoded so you recognize more easily what field is taken by which player.

It isnt new or innovative but its fun to code and it helped me learning rust :)

I hope you have fun with it.

P.S. in src/ only the main.rs file is required to compile it.

How to compile it:
1. go into the directory tic_tac_toe, there you should find the Cargo.toml file and the src directory
2. install everything needed in order to work with rust projects (search on the web for something like "How to install rust on Linux/Windows/MacOS")
3. run "cargo build --release" or "cargo run --release" to compile it (and execute it after compiling when using run instead of build)
4. the binary should be fund under target/release/tic_tac_toe

I hope you have fun with it and feel free to modify it to your liking :)
